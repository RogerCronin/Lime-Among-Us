# Lime

Do you loving playing Among Us? Do you hate your friends? Accuse your friends and family of being imposter with just a single command!

## How to Use

`lime help` - Sends a helpful message.

`lime accuse` - Accuses a random member of the server of being imposter.

`lime invite` - Sends an invite link to the bot.

If you'd like to self host for some reason, all you have to do is download `index.js`, install discord.js, and put your bot token in a file called `token.txt`. It's being hosted on a Raspberry Pi hidden in my desk and should have 24/7 uptime as long as my WiFi or power doesn't go out.
